# Software-Engineering  Hello! This is ShelterSource ( Community Connect) 
Read me- description on compiling and running code. 

We have initiated our project with index html and mysql database. We use php to communicate server side with the data. 
In order to test the code, download all the files and start with the index.html in any supporting browser. 
The .sql must be inserted into a databsase and retrived with the html/php pages.
