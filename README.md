Description on compiling and running code: 

We have initiated our project with an index html and the mysql database. We use php to communicate the server with the data. 
To edit and create our .html page, we used ATOM IDE. We also used MYSQL and MAMP to test local database server. 
In order to test the code, download all the files and open the index.html in any supporting browser. 
The .sql file must be inserted into a database and retrived with the html/php pages. The .sql file can be copied and pasted into the database query to create tables. In our current process, the html and php connection works but database is still being configured and selected in order to best serve our needs. Our html page sucessfully displays a couple options for counties and a submit button to send a form to our action_page php form.
